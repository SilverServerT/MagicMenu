# MagicMenu

A Geyser Extension that allows you to run commnds by using an emote. Has support for various placeholders, and allows for user input on parts of the commands.
Fully configurable! Define multiple forms (different ones for different players), chain them to one another, and even add images to buttons so they're more lively!

### This is an extension for Geyser; NOT a plugin/mod. To install it, drop the .jar file in Geyser's extensions folder.

Download available soon in the releases tab.

## DISCLAIMER: While this project is made to work with Geyser (literally a geyser extension), it is not an official one - for help, ask in issues here or on the linked discord.

Configuration:

There are main "elements":

- emote definitions: to run show forms/commands for different emotes
- forms: to show different buttons, with or without images
- buttons: When clicked, they can execute commands, or show another form
- command holders: Hold the command, the name for it, the users allowed to run it, and the command to run them (with placeholder/player input placeholders support)
